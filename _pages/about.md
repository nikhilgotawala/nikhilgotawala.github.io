I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Virginia Tech, working under the supervision of **[Prof. Hang Yu](https://www.mse.vt.edu/people/faculty/yu-hang.html)**. My research focuses on **solid-state manufacturing processes**, particularly friction stir welding (FSW) and additive friction stir deposition (AFSD). I completed my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India, under the guidance of **Prof. Amber Shrivastava**.

My expertise lies in **coupled numerical modeling** and **computational material science**. I specialize in developing advanced CFD-based numerical models for solid-state manufacturing processes, investigating microstructure evolution, phase transformations, and material flow behavior. My research combines multi-physics modeling with experimental characterization to understand the underlying mechanisms governing material behavior in solid-state processes.

My current work at Virginia Tech focuses on **additive friction stir deposition (AFSD)**, where I develop 3D CFD-based thermo-mechanical models to predict material flow paths and thermomechanical properties. I also investigate heterogeneous lamellar microstructures and tool wear in high-strength alloys.

**PS: I am actively seeking research collaborations in solid-state manufacturing and materials processing. If you are interested, please drop me an email.**
