I am a graduate student in the Computer Science department at Virginia Tech, advised by **[Dr. Bimal Viswanath](https://people.cs.vt.edu/vbimal/)**. As a Generative AI enthusiast, my research focuses on **security and generative AI**. I am honored to have received the **Pratt Fellowship** from the CS department.

My expertise lies in conversational AI systems, particularly chatbots. I am currently investigating and mitigating toxicity in chatbots and working on model customization pipelines. My research explores attacks and defenses using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, I have experience in the Computer Vision (CV) domain, working on deepfakes, GANs, and diffusion models. 

Beyond my research, I have 4.5 years of consulting experience, during which I worked on several large-scale projects with US-based clients. At Deloitte Consulting, I specialized as an Oracle Payroll Implementation Specialist. I completed my Bachelor's in Information Technology in 2016 from VNR VJIET, Hyderabad (affiliated with JNTU), where I gained research experience in Temporal Data Mining and Network Security.

**PS: I am actively seeking research internship roles in generative AI and security for Summer 2025. If you are interested, please drop me an email.**
